# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview
This project allowed me to get familiar with handling large data sets using PySpark and Google's CoLab. The task was to analyze Amazon reviews for video games and see if there was a bias towards reviews written as part of the Vine program.

## Results

- Vine Reviews
    - Number of reviews: 94
    - Number of 5 star reviews: 48
    - Percent of 5 star reviews: 51%
- Non-Vine Reviews
    - Number of reviews: 40471
    - Number of 5 star reviews: 15663
    - Percent of 5 star reviews: 38.7%

## Summary
A little over half of the reviews in the Vine program tended to give 5-star reviews vs. the 38% of reviews that were not part of the Vine program. The results tell me that there is a general bias towards reviews written by people in the vine program.
